				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>
					I am a French engineering student who enjoys programing lots of things.
					I started with C/C++ when I was 16 and explored a lot of languages and technologies
					(Python, MATLAB, HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, SQL...) <br />
					I especially like working on low-level projects, starting from scratch,
					as well as projects related to rendering.
