			<h1>Fraus</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>What is Fraus?</h2>
				<p>
					Fraus is a rendering engine based on Vulkan and written in C.
					It is a personal project that I started in order to learn Vulkan and rendering.
					It is still in development but can already be used to display a single object.

				<h2>Plans</h2>
				<p>
					I am currently working on adding first person camera controls.
					I will then work on being able to display multiple objects.

				<h2>Why "Fraus"?</h2>
				<p>
					Fraus is a rendering engine, it renders images that mimic reality.
					Therefore, it is kind of misleading and mischievious.
					Also, it is based on Vulkan, which is the name of the Roman god of the forge.
					It then seemed reasonable to use "Fraus" which is the name of the Roman goddess of deception.
