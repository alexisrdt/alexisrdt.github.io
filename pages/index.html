				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>
					I am a French engineering student at CentraleSup√©lec.
					I am also doing a double degree in the Robotics master at EPFL. <br/>
					I discovered programming when I was 16.
					I started with C/C++ and explored a lot of languages and technologies since then
					(Python, MATLAB, HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, SQL...) <br />
					I especially like working on low-level projects, starting from scratch,
					as well as projects related to rendering.

				<h1>Fraus</h1>
				<p>
					Fraus is a rendering engine based on Vulkan and written in C.
					It is my main project at the moment and I am working on it in my free time.
