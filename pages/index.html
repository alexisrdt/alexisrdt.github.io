				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>
					I am a French engineering student at CentraleSup√©lec.
					I am also doing a double degree in the Robotics master at EPFL. <br />
					I discovered programming when I was 16.
					I started with C/C++ and explored a lot of languages and technologies since then
					(Python, MATLAB, HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, SQL...) <br />
					I especially like working on low-level projects, starting from scratch,
					as well as projects related to rendering. <br />
					During my studies, I had the opportunity to work on varied projects,
					ranging from making an autonomous vehicle drive itself on a grid
					to optimizing the distribution of passengers in a plane. <br />
					You can have more details about my education or the several projects I have worked on
					by visiting my LinkedIn profile.
					You can also have an overview of what I am working on at the moment on my GitHub profile.

					Fraus is a rendering engine based on Vulkan and written in C.
					It is my main project at the moment and I am working on it in my free time.
